# Yatzy

CSI3140 Assignment 2
Group46

Description:
A Yatzy game is has a player rolling five dice. After each roll, the player chooses which dice to keep, and which to reroll. A player can then reroll up to two times on a turn. The player must put a score into an available score box. The game ends when all the score boxes are used and a final tally is given.

How it works:
Like any other yatzy game, you roll the dice and pick which dice(s) you would like to keep until all your rolls are done. While you roll your dice, the table will have a predicted score if the score is to your satisfaction you can click on it and confirm the points.

Design:
I decided to keep it design pretty standard and clean, added a black background and highlighted the main title and roll button as yellow for a nice contrast.
